Natural language driven CI/CD with Terraform integrations.

## 🎯 The Vision

**Stop writing YAML. Start talking.**

Traditional infrastructure deployment is broken. We're fixing it with natural language and AI.

## What We Do

Transform infrastructure deployment through conversational AI. Describe your infrastructure needs in plain English, and we'll generate and deploy the appropriate Terraform configurations.

## ✨ The Magic

```
You: "I need a production-ready web app"
Stratisail: *deploys entire stack in 30 seconds*
```

## 🔥 Why Stratisail?

- **🗣️ Just Talk** - No more config files
- **⚡ Instant Deploy** - From idea to production
- **🧠 AI Native** - Learns your patterns
- **🛡️ Battle Tested** - Enterprise ready

## Core Concept

Instead of writing complex Terraform configurations:

```bash
# Traditional approach
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="prod.tfvars"
terraform apply
```

Simply describe what you need:

```
"Deploy a web application with load balancer and database on AWS"
```

## Architecture

```
Natural Language Input → Intent Parsing → Terraform Generation → CI/CD Pipeline → Deployment
```

## Repositories

## 🚀 Get Started

```bash
npx stratisail@latest
