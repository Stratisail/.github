> Infrastructure that speaks your language


Natural language driven CI/CD with Terraform integrations.

## ðŸŽ¯ The Vision

**Stop writing YAML. Start talking.**

Traditional infrastructure deployment is broken. We're fixing it with natural language and AI.

## What We Do

Transform infrastructure deployment through conversational AI. Describe your infrastructure needs in plain English, and we'll generate and deploy the appropriate Terraform configurations.



## Core Concept

Instead of writing complex Terraform configurations:

```bash
# Traditional approach
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="prod.tfvars"
terraform apply
```

Simply describe what you need:

```
"Deploy a CI/CD pipeline that works with my Terraform"
```

That's it. Really.
